# Virtual-pet project
Manchester Codes virtual-pet project.
The virtual-pet project is a game that requires you to care for a pet online!

Interact with the pet:

- You can give them a name

- They can get older

- As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

- You can walk your pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️

- You can feed your pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕

- You can talk to your pet to see if it needs feeding or walking

- If your pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀

- If your pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
